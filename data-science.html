      <p style="margin-top:10px;">
        This project is based on Data Science and Machine Learning.  <br>
        In this project I worked on data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and prediction. <br>
        I used Python libraries to train ML models and generate results. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is titled <b>Predictive Crime Analysis, Trend and Forecasting</b>. It uses historical crime data and machine learning techniques to analyze patterns, trends, and forecast future crime occurrences. The main objective is to gain meaningful insights from crime datasets, identify high-risk regions, and build predictive models that can help inform proactive safety measures.
      </p><br>

      <p>
        The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data visualization, trend analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Various machine learning algorithms are applied to detect patterns and forecast future crime trends. This approach demonstrates the practical application of data science in real-world societal challenges.
      </p><br>

      <p>
        The project helps in understanding how crime data behaves over time, provides visualization of crime trends, and implements predictive modeling to estimate potential future crime occurrences. Findings from this project can support decision making and resource allocation for improved public safety.
