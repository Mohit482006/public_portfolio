  <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I am Mohit Singh Bhadoriya, a passionate Full Stack Developer and an aspiring Data Scientist. I love creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites that look professional and work smoothly. I enjoy working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to build complete web applications. Along with web development, I am also learning Python for Data Science and Machine Learning because I want to explore how data can be used to solve real-world problems. I have worked on projects like my Portfolio Website with an admin panel and a Data Science project based on Predictive Crime Analysis, Trend, and Forecasting. These projects helped me learn data cleaning, visualization, analysis, and model training using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
    I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science from Amity University Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior. I completed my schooling from Government Boys Higher Secondary School under MP Board, where I scored 93% in 10th and 86% in 12th. I always try to improve my skills every day by practicing coding and learning new concepts. I also enjoy participating in coding challenges and hackathons, which helps me build teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. My hobbies include listening to music, going to the gym, learning new skills, and coding regularly. My goal is to become a successful software developer and data science professional in the future.
